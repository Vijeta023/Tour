                <br>
                <br>

            <h3>Mehrangarh Fort</h3>
            <br>

            <p>The Fort of Jodhpur crowns a rocky hill that rises 400 feet above the surrounding plain, and appears both to command and to meld with the landscape. One of the largest forts in Rajasthan, it contains some of the finest palaces and preserves in its museum many priceless relics of Indian courtly life.

                For over five centuries Mehrangarh has been the headquarters of the senior branch of Rajput clan known as the Rathores. According to their bards, the ruling dynasty of this clan had at an earlier period controlled Kanauj (in what is known as Uttar Pradesh). Like other prominent medieval Rajput rulers – including the famous Prithviraj Chauhan – they were defeated by the invaders from Afghanistan at the end of the 12th century.</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Umaid Bhawan Palace
            </h3>
            <br>

            <p>  
                Umaid Bhawan Palace, located in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India, is one of the world’s largest private residences. A part of the palace is managed by Taj Hotels. It is named after Maharaja Umaid Singh, grandfather of the present owner, Gaj Singh. The palace has 347 rooms and is the principal residence of the former Jodhpur royal family. A part of the palace is not a residence

                The groundbreaking for the foundations of the building was carried out on 18 November 1929 by Maharaja Umaid Singh and the construction work was completed in 1943.</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Taj Mahal of Marwar</h3>
            <br>

            <p> 
                The beautiful memorial in marble often described as the “Taj Mahal of Marwar” was built in memory of Maharaja Jaswant Singhjill of Jodhpur (1873-1895) by his son Maharaja Sardar Singhji (1895-1911) and completed in 1906 A.D. The main hall has been built like a temple where puja (ritual) is also performed. The worship of ancestors is common to the Rajput clans.

                Today, Jaswant Thada is managed and looked after by the Mehrangarh Museum Trust (MMT) and is open to the public. The Trust is operating a Museum in Jaswant Thada displaying portraits of Marwar rulers along with informative didactics – the information serves as an orientation space to understand the history of Marwar through the Portraits. Its grounds serve as a serene venue for morning concerts during music festivals such as the Rajasthan International Folk Festival and the World Sacred Spirit Festival.
