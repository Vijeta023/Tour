                <br> The outer wall was built by Maharaja Jai Singh II, but other additions are much more recent, some dating back to the beginning of the 20th century. The palace is a wonderful blend of Rajasthani and Mughal architectural style. The City Place of Jaipur is a major tourist attraction in Rajasthan.

            <h3>Astronomical Observatory (Jantar Mantar)</h3>
            <br>

            <div id="mainn" class="main"> <p>Between 1727 and 1734 Maharajah Jai Singh II of Jaipur constructed five astronomical observatories in west-central India. The observatories, or “Jantar Mantar” as they are commonly known, incorporate multiple buildings of unique form, each with a specialized function for astronomical measurement.<br>
                <br> These structures with their striking combinations of geometric forms at large scale, have captivated the attention of architects, artists, and art historians worldwide, yet remain largely unknown to the general public.
                <br>
                <br>
                Jantar Mantar presents the observatories through a variety of media and information sources, making it possible to explore and learn about these historic sites through interactive panoramic “VR” photographs, time-lapse sequences, and 3D models as well as articles, drawings, and historic texts. It is a comprehensive resource for exploring the observatories in depth.

            <h3>Amer Fort

            </h3>
            <br>

            <div id="main3" class="main"> <p>The Amer Fort is situated in Amer, which is 11 kilometres from Jaipur. Amer, originally, was the capital of the state before Jaipur. It is an old fort, built-in 1592 by Raja Man Singh. This fort is also very popularly known as the Amer Palace. <br>
                <br>The Amer Fort was built in red sandstone and marble and the Maotha Lake adds a certain charm to the entire Fort. Though the fort is quite old and may even look so from the outside, it is beautiful on the inside and boasts of various buildings of prominence like the ‘Diwan-i-Aam’, the ‘Sheesh Mahal’ and even the ‘Sukh Mahal’. The Amer Fort has influences of both Hindu and Muslim architecture.<br>
                <br> This fort also has the ‘Shila Devi’ Temple and the ‘Ganesh Pol’ which is a gate that leads to the private palaces of the kings. The Amer Fort has many pavilions and halls of great interest and other popular attractions

                .</p>

            <h3>Jaigarh Fort

            </h3>

            <br>
            <p>The Jaigarh fort is the most spectacular of the three-hilltop forts that overlook Jaipur. In Mughal times, the Jaipur region was a major weapon-producing centre for the Mughal and Rajput rulers, several of the weapons being on display in the fort’s museum.<br>
                <br> It is one of the few military structures of medieval India preserved almost intact, containing palaces, a granary, a well-planned cannon foundry, several temples, a tall tower and giant mounted cannon-the Jai Ban (Jaivan) which is the largest cannon on wheels in the world. Jaigarh Fort is also known as the fort of victory. The display includes a collection of canons, many of which are exquisitely decorated and were used in the Mughal campaigns led by the Rajput King, Raja Man Singh.<br>
                <br>

                Of Jaipur’s three forts, Jaigarh is perhaps the most imposing. It does not have those delicate structures or palaces like that of Amber but if you want a quick look at a hard-core fortress, this is it. Jaigarh means `Victory Fort’ and was built between the 15th and the 18th century AD, and stands 15 km from Jaipur, amidst rock-strewn, thorn-scrub covered hills, its forbidding stone ramparts being visible from the Jaipur town. A steep road goes up to the main gate, the Dungar Darwaza, from where the view is are inspiring.</p>

            <h3>Nahargarh Fort

            </h3>
            <br>

<p>Nahargarh Fort is located on the rugged ridge of Aravali Hills and it forms an impressive northern backdrop of Jaipur. It looks most classy when floodlit at night. The fort overlooks the city and presents a glittering view of the city lights. It was built in 1734 and extended in 1868. Nahargarh meaning abode of the tigers was built by Jai Singh to bolster the defence of Amber.<br>
    <br> The legend has it that it was named Nahargarh after Nahar Singh, a prince whose spirit would destroy the construction and stall its progress. So after a Tantrik invoked the spirit, it agreed to withdraw on condition that the fort would be named after him. The Madhavendra Bhawan, built by Sawai Madho Singh has a unique cluster of 12 identical suites for queens and at the head is a suite for the king himself. <br>
    <br>The rooms are linked by corridors and retain some delicate frescoes as well as toilets and kitchen hearths. It was used by members of the royal family for an excursion in summers and is even now a favoured picnic spot. Durg Cafeteria just above the entrance sells meals and refreshments, while Padao Restaurant on the west sells drinks around sunset.

                <br> Mandawa used to a busy market town for Rajput merchants. It was during that period, the Rajputs built a number of palatial mansions. It was their initiative to build the archways, murals etc. as well. This actually helped in imparting a royal ambiance and vintage charm to the place. The traders used to work in different parts of the country.<br>
                <br> However, whenever there was a question of building a palatial mansion, they built it in Mandawa. These mansions marked their wealth and prosperity.

            <div id="main6" class="main">  <p>Just over five centuries old, Bikaner was founded by a scion of the house of Marwar (Jodhpur). The fort of Bikaner, Junagadh, however, was built in 1593 by Raja Rai Singh who also served as a general in the army of Emperor Akbar. Made from red sandstone and encircled by a moat around which the modern city of Bikaner has spread in a somewhat erratic fashion, Junagadh consists of several palaces and apartments in a remarkable state of preservation. The art of mason and sculptor is most obvious in the recreation of delicate stone screens, kiosks, pavilions and series of arched entrances to buildings reached from corridors that have windows overlooking the city beyond.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some of the palaces are among the most richly decorated in Rajasthan and include Anup Mahal, Chandra Mahal and Phool Mahal. They give the impression of rich inlay of pietra dura, though in fact the apartments are merely richly painted. The paintings have been preserved as good as new because of the extremely dry heat conditions of the desert town. Another palace, Badal Mahal recreated the painting of clouds on its walls, a reminder of the monsoon that often failed the settlement. The Anup Mahal courtyard has a throne set in a pool of water. Bringing alive the sensitivity the rulers showed in their building environment.
